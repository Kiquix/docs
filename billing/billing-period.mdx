description: "How Fred's monthly billing cycle works."
---

Fred charges your subscription fee monthly. Each billing period starts on the day you first subscribed and ends on the same date the following month.

**Example:** If you subscribe on the 15th, your billing period runs from the 15th of one month through the 14th of the next.

## Unused allowances

Any unused features or allowances within a billing period do not carry over to the next cycle. Each period starts fresh.
