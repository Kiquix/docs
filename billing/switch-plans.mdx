## Switch plans

To upgrade or downgrade your plan:

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Open the **Billing** tab.
3. You'll be taken to the Stripe portal where you can select a new plan.

### Upgrading

Your new plan takes effect immediately. You gain access to higher usage limits and more team member slots right away.

### Downgrading

When you downgrade, your current plan's limits remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. After that, the lower limits apply. If your usage exceeds the new plan's limits at that point, Fred will prompt you to take action.

<Warning>
  If you downgrade to a plan with fewer team member slots, you may need to remove team members to comply with the new limit.
