## Project

A project is the primary container for your research in Fred. It represents the main goal or purpose of a research effort and can hold multiple studies, each focused on a different aspect of that goal.

For example, a project called "Mobile checkout redesign" might contain separate studies for navigation testing, preference testing of new designs, and a follow-up survey.

## Study

A study is a focused research effort within a project. It addresses a specific research objective and contains one or more methods. Once a study is live, you share it with testers via a link and results flow back into the project.

## Method

A method is a tool used to collect data from participants within a study. Fred provides eight methods — from card sorting to moderated usability tests. You can use a single method or combine several in one study to build a tailored research experience.

## Insights

Insights is the section where you create, manage, and categorize your tags. It acts as a central hub for organizing findings across your studies, making it easy to identify patterns and trends.

## Tag

A tag is a label or keyword you apply to specific pieces of text or data within study results. Tags help you categorize information and surface recurring themes, pain points, or opportunities.

## Documentation

Documentation is Fred's built-in report builder. It lets you create, compile, and share reports that include study results and insights in a structured, shareable format.
