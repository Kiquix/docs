Insights is the central hub for organizing your research findings. It's where you create and manage tags — labels you apply to specific pieces of text or data within your study results.

## Tags

A tag is a keyword or label you assign to a response or a piece of data. Tags let you group related findings across responses and studies, making it easier to spot patterns, recurring themes, and key pain points.

## Create and manage tags

1. Click **Insights** in the left sidebar.
2. Use the interface to create new tags, edit existing ones, or organize them into categories.

Once a tag exists, you can apply it to specific responses within your study results.

## Applying tags to results

When reviewing study responses, select a piece of text or a data point and assign one or more tags to it. Over time, tagged data helps you build a structured view of what your users are experiencing.

<Tip>
  Use consistent tag names across projects to make it easier to compare findings over time.
