A method is a specific tool you add to a study to collect data. Fred provides eight methods, which you can use individually or combine within a single study.

## Available methods

### Card sorting

Uncover how your users mentally structure and categorize information. Participants arrange labeled cards into groups that make sense to them, revealing their mental models. Use this to improve navigation, labeling, and information architecture.

### Questions

A flexible survey tool for gathering user opinions and feedback. You can include a wide range of question types:

- Multiple choice
- Yes / No
- Short text and long text
- Numerical
- Date
- Linear scale
- Multiple choice grid
- Time

Use Questions to supplement other methods or run standalone surveys.

### Tree test

Test how easily users find information within your site or app structure. Participants navigate a simplified text version of your hierarchy to complete tasks, revealing where your navigation breaks down.

### First click

Observe where users click first when trying to complete a task. First-click tests assess whether your interface design guides users toward the right action from the start.

### 5-second test

Show a design to a participant for five seconds, then ask what they remember or understood. Use this to evaluate whether your design communicates the intended message at a glance.

### Preference test

Present two or more design alternatives and ask participants to choose their preference and explain why. Use this to compare design directions before committing to one.

### Unmoderated usability test

Participants complete tasks on your website or app independently, without a moderator. Their interactions are recorded so you can observe where they succeed or struggle. Best for validating design solutions at scale.

### User Sphere

A fully moderated session platform. You guide participants through tasks in real time, ask follow-up questions, and gather rich qualitative data. User Sphere supports:

- Live streaming and screen sharing
- Researcher, tester, and spectator roles
- Whiteboards and file sharing
- Real-time note-taking
