A project represents the main goal or purpose of a research effort. It can contain multiple studies, each addressing a different aspect of that goal. Think of a project as the umbrella under which all your related research lives.

## Create a project

1. Click **Projects** or **Dashboard** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Add new project** (top right).
3. Enter a project name and an optional description.
4. Click **Create project**.

Your project is ready. You can add studies to it immediately or come back later.

<Tip>
  Use the description to capture the main research question or goal so your team understands the project's purpose at a glance.

## Add studies to a project

Once a project exists, you can add as many studies as you need. Each study focuses on a specific research objective and uses one or more methods.

## View results

Once testers complete your live studies, results appear on the project page. Each study shows its responses and method-specific analytics in one place.
