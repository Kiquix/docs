The report builder (called **Documentation** in the sidebar) lets you compile study results, insights, and commentary into a structured report you can share with colleagues, stakeholders, or clients.

## Create a report

1. Click **Documentation** in the left sidebar.
2. Select the project you want to document.
3. Use the editor to build your report:
   - Click the **+** icon to add content blocks — text, headings, lists, and images.
   - Import tester responses directly from your studies.
4. When your report is ready, click the **PDF** button to export it.
5. Share the downloaded PDF with your stakeholders.

## What to include

A good research report typically covers:

- **Research goal** — what question the study was trying to answer
- **Methodology** — which methods were used and why
- **Key findings** — the most important patterns and insights from the data
- **Tagged themes** — recurring issues or opportunities you identified
- **Recommendations** — actionable next steps based on the research

<Tip>
  Import tester responses directly into the report to support your findings with real participant data.
