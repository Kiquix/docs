Once a study is live, you can share it with testers using a link. Testers don't need a Fred account to participate.

## Share a study

1. Go to the project containing your study.
2. In the **Studies overview**, find the study you want to share.
3. Click the three-dot menu next to the study.
4. Select **Share link**.
5. Copy the URL from the modal and send it to your testers.

<Warning>
  The **Share link** option is only available for studies that are set to **live**. Draft studies cannot be shared.
</Warning>

## Set a study to live

When you finish building a study, click **Add study to project**. You'll be asked whether to go live immediately or save as a draft. If you saved it as a draft, you can set it to live later from the study settings.

## Collecting responses

Once testers access the link and complete the study, their responses are collected automatically and appear on the project page. You can view results and analytics for each method as responses come in — no need to wait for all testers to finish.
