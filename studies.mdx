A study contains one or more research methods and produces a shareable link you can send to testers. Once testers complete the study, their responses appear on the project page.

## Create a study

1. Open the project you want to add a study to.
2. Click **Add new study** or **Add study** (top right).
3. Enter a study name and an optional description.
4. Click **Build study** to open the study editor.
5. Click **Add new block** to add your first method.
6. Repeat to add more methods if needed.
7. Click **Add study to project** when you're done.

You'll see a confirmation. You can then:

- **Go live** immediately — the study becomes active and you can share the link with testers.
- **Save as draft** — keep it private while you continue editing.

<Note>
  Once a study is live and you've shared the link, results are collected automatically on the project page.

## Combine methods in one study

You can add multiple methods to a single study. For example, combine a **5-Second Test** to measure first impressions with a **Questions** survey to capture detailed feedback — all in one tester session.

## Share your study

Once the study is live, share the link with your testers.
