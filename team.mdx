Fred is built for collaboration. Your subscription plan determines how many team members you can have.

| Plan | Team members |
|---|---|
| Freelancer | 1 |
| Studio | Up to 5 |
| Agency | Up to 15 |

## Invite a team member

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Open the **Team** tab.
3. Click **Invite new member** (top right).
4. Enter the invitee's email address and send the invitation, or copy the generated invitation link and share it directly.

The invitee will receive an email with instructions to join your team.

## Remove a team member

From the **Team** tab in Settings, you can remove members who no longer need access to your workspace.

## Plan capacity

If you downgrade to a lower plan, your team size limit decreases. If your current team exceeds the new limit, you'll need to remove members to comply with the plan's capacity before or after the downgrade takes effect.
